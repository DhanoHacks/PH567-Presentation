# Usage:
* `python3 bifurcation.py`: Plot Bifurcation Diagram. Change variable `mode` to choose between logistic, sine, and quadratic maps.
* `python3 lyapunov_exponent_plot.py`: Plot Lyapunov Exponents. Change variable `mode` to choose between logistic, sine, and quadratic maps.
* `python3 feigenbaum.py`: Calculate Feigenbaum Constant $\delta$ from bifurcation points. Change variable `mode` to choose between logistic, sine, and quadratic maps.

Pre existing bifurcation diagrams and lyapunov exponent plots are in the `slides/plots` folder.
Slides in .tex and .pdf format are in the the `slides` folder.
Pre calculated feigenbaum constants are in the `results.txt` files.
